Our stack: 

-React JS for UI components
-Sass for styles
-React Router Dom for Routing

To edit styles open ./src/theme 

Within that folder you'll find:

 * A mixin file which provides the template for style-mixins that should be used in all ./styles.module.scss files
 * A variables file with the colors, sizes etc..
