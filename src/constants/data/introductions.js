    position: 'Product Manager & UI/UX Designer',
    introduction: "When I was 15 years old, I had my first and in many ways formative experience with entrepreneurship. At that time I made an eCommerce store and sold stainless steel drinking bottles. Nothing special, but for me this was a pivotal moment, because I recognized that I could actively shape the world, that all the products I use every day were made by people not much different from me - the desire to create things rather than just consume is also what would attract me to Web3 later in my life.   In the following years I worked on all sorts of small and big projects, including job boards, a data analysis tool and newsletter for the SPAC market, as well as an online platform for luxury vacation rentals.  In the process, I've acquired knowledge in all kinds of areas, ranging from UI/UX design and marketing to a basic understanding of programming languages - because as a solopreneur I had no other choice than to do it all myself. I've also been involved with many DAOs as a contributor and/or community member for the past years, and not only witnessed first hand the tremendous disruptive potential of Web3, but also connected with a lot of interesting people along the way.What excites me the most about Decentra is the fact that we can help enable platform agnostic communities for the first time, and also empower them with the ability to use non-transferable tokens for reputation management within their organization, enabling all kinds of new governance frameworks and a decentralized power structure.",

    position: 'Fullstack Developer',
    introduction: "I am a software developer interested in building the infrastructure of the future, my journey started 3 years ago when I self taught myself programming and set my sights on creating a better internet for myself an others. I've always admired and saw beauty in disruptive technologies that give power back to the people, to providing everyone with the tools necessary to grow their business, communities and online environment. My career has led me to working with many talented and interesting individuals, learning essential programming tools like Javascript, Agile, blockchains and database administration.  Lately my interest in DAOs, web3 and cryptocurrency has pushed me to working on decentralised applications and connecting with my co-founders in Decentra.  I hope to assist in bringing a vision of a free, open and complex internet to life.",
